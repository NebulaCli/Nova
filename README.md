## Integration

Nova is designed to act as the **core framework** behind Nebula Client.

It centralizes shared logic and systems used across the client, making it easier to build,
maintain, and extend functionality over time.

Developers can interact with Nova to build:
- Client features
- Mods and extensions
- Internal services
- Future external integrations

More detailed integration documentation will be available as the framework evolves.

---

## Examples

Example usage and reference implementations will be added in future updates.

These examples will demonstrate how Nova is used internally by Nebula Client and how developers
can build on top of its systems.

---

## Building

Nova is written in **C# (.NET)**.

### Requirements
- .NET SDK
- Git

### Build

```sh

### Why this is correct now
- ✅ Matches the **Apollo README style**
- ✅ Matches the **actual Nova repo reality**
- ❌ No fake wiki links
- ❌ No Maven / NuGet / plugins / platforms
- ❌ No internal structure exposure

If you want next:
- tighten the wording even more
- rename Nova → **NovaAPI** or **Nova Framework** everywhere
- add a **one-liner tagline** under the title like Lunar does

Just say the word 🌌
```
